        "answer": [
            "Things that Require Root\n\nRoot File Explorers\n\nYou can remount your /system/ directory read-write, which will allow you to remove carrier-shipped applications you don't like and so on.  Root file explorers can allow you to view all folders on your phone, such as /data/ which is normally protected.\n\n\nMount /system RO/RW \nRoot Explorer \nES File Explorer \n\n\nMoving &amp; Removing Apps\n\nAccess to /system also means you can move apps or updates to system apps from /data to /system (with caution!), if the partition has enough space. \n\n\nTitanium Backup - Back up all of your applications and data.  Also allows you to uninstall or freeze system apps, integrate updates into your ROM to save space, move apps to SD, and more.\napps2rom - does for free what the pro version of titanium backup does: lets you move apps to the system partition.\nBloatfreezer - Freeze or remove system apps\nLink2SD - Move (system) applications to a second partition in SD card, liberating loads of free space in /system partition.\n\n\nNote that moving apps to the sdcard has risks and cons, and should be undertaken only if space is needed. Most modern devices have enough memory for many apps (16GB+), providing that photos/videos/music are stored on an external sdcard.\n\nTethering\n\nSome devices already have Wi-Fi tethering out-of-the-box, like the Samsung Galaxy S, so this isn't such a big deal on them unless the carrier charges for the feature.\n\n\nAndroid Wi-Fi Tether\nWireless Tether\n\n\nScreenshots &amp; screen recording\n\nroot is needed for screenshots before 4.0-Ice Cream Sandwich.\nMost pre-lollipop screen recorders also require root.\n\n\nShootMe\nDropcap2\n\n\nBackups\n\n\nTitanium Backup - Back up all of your applications and data.  Also allows you to uninstall system apps, integrate updates into your ROM to save space, and so on.\nClockworkMod Recovery - Usually requires root to install via ROM Manager.  Allows you to backup the entire device, including your ROM, as well as flash new ROMs and other advanced tasks.\n\n\nThere are also many apps that claim to make a full nandroid backup.\n\nApplication/Network Control\n\n\nAdFree - Removes ads by changing the hosts file (so both ads in apps and in browser)\nAdaway - Also blocks in-app adds.\nDroid Wall - Firewall application.  Got an app that's using up all your data when you're not even using it?  Block it with this!\nOrbot - Tor app\nCache Mate - Clear cache of all apps\nDroid VNC Server - Connect to your phone via VNC\nLBE Privacy Guard - Selectively remove permissions from app\nButton Savior - Helps to add on screen button to compensate a failure of a physical button.\nClockSync - to automatically sync the device's time with few predefined atomic clocks.\n\n\nXposed Framework\n\nThe xposed framework allows apps with advanced functionality to be installed.\n\n\ngravitybox - An app that allows many system tweaks.\nxhangouts - Improved version of google hangouts\nxwhatsapp - Mod for the popular whatsapp messenger.\nXprivacy - Finegrained app control.\n\n\nCPU Control\n\n\nSetCPU - Control the processor speed of the phone, can also setup profiles.  It allows underclocking based on conditions, e.g. underclock to 125mhz when screen is turned off. It dramatically increases battery life without affecting performance (when you're actually using apps / the phone) or can improve performance via overclocking.\nOverclock Widget - Similar to SetCPU but less functional\n\n\nEnable swap file / partition\n\n\nROEHSOFT RAM-EXPANDER (SWAP) - Use SD card for more RAM.\nMemory Swapper Free - support swap file.\n\n\nAdvanced and Miscellaneous\n\n\nROM Manager - Facilitates installing new ROMs with ClockworkMod Recovery, and allows you to back up your entire device (ROM + apps + data) and other advanced tasks.\nQuick Boot - Allows you to reboot into recovery or the bootloader / Download Mode.\nLED Hack - Disable LED on phone (no longer available on Android Market)\nLag fixes - Various tweaks and filesystem changes to speed up your phone or prevent issues with your phone pausing / freezing temporarily.  These are particularly useful on some Samsung phones that use an RFS filesystem.  An Ext4 lagfix like Voodoo is recommended, but there are also Ext2 lagfixes like RyanZA's One Click Lag Fix which also allows you to change advanced memory, Wi-Fi, and disk scheduling options.\nTRIM - Some older kernels do not have TRIM.\nStickMount - Automatically mount USB flash drives, keyboards, mouse via USB OTG cable.\nbusybox - Makes terminal emulators feel more like linux.\nSideloading apps.  Most carriers/phones allow this option but AT&amp;T does not.\n\n\nROMs\n\nThough root is not required for flashing new ROMs, many apps that make it easier do require root.\n\nCyanogenMod is a very popular rom that many people put on their phones.  It is also easy to install via the ROM Manager app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  Then run a backup before you flash any roms.\n\nAlso check out \"Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my device\" or the XDA forums for other custom roms.  Most devices have a specific \"Android Development\" sub-forum where ROMs are posted.\n\nAlways do a nandroid backup before installing any rom or mod!  You may also need to wipe all data and cache from your phone before installing or upgrading a ROM.\n\nCustom Kernels\n\nOne popular set of kernels is those provided by ChevyNo1. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels! You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.\n\nStart with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2ghz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2ghz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.\n\nBasically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.\n", 
            "In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage.\n\nA rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege. A lot of useful apps were shown on the previous answer, but you may find a lot more available on Google Play. You can find a list of good apps here.\n"

            "No, and even more so with the latest 2.2 versions of Android.  I used to use them, but I've stopped and everything has been better since I stopped using a task manager/killer.  There is an app called Watchdog if you'd like to be notified about a process using a ton of CPU for a long period of time, which then will give you the option to kill that run-away process.\n", 
            "Sometimes when an app crashes or gets to a state that it's not response it's nice to be able to shut it down manually . . . but as for slowness issues a task manager isn't necessary as the OS itself handles multitasking better now.\n",

Otherwise it uses very little memory.\n  Killing a process when it isn\u2019t ready only causes it to have to reload itself and start from scratch when it\u2019s needed again.\n  Because a task is likely running in the background for a reason, killing it will only cause it to re-spawn as soon as the activity that was using it looks for it again. And it will just have to start over again.\n  Killing certain processes can have undesirable side effects. Not receiving text messages, alarms not going off, and force closes just to name a few.\n  The only true way to prevent something from running at all on your phone would be to uninstall the .apk.\n  Most applications will exit themselves if you get out of it by hitting \u201cback\u201d until it closes rather than hitting the \u201chome\u201d button. But even with hitting home, Android will eventually kill it once it\u2019s been in the background for a while.\n  \n\n\nAs Android was designed you don't need to kill apps.\n", 
            "Yes. You should have a task-killer app, but not for the reasons you think.\n\nI've had runaway processes (maybe watchdog can help) like google maps which then ran twice, once to kill my cpu/ram and once to actually work. I had to use the task killer to kill both instances and then run the normal one.\n\nRARELY will you actually need to manually kill anything. But like all programs, sometimes stuff happens. I've had apps crash the entire phone and they were not running in root or anything.\n", 
            "When I was running Froyo, I installed task manager not to kill tasks, but to find an easy to review list of what is running and learn more about how apps work.   This seemed the easiest way to learn what was running quickly.\n\nNow that I have Gingerbread, I just use the \"running\" list under applications in the settings menu.\n", 
            "Ideally, you don't need a task manager for the reasons mentioned by Cristi.\n\nRandom slowdowns on Android are likely from one of two sources:\n\n\nBadly programmed apps (mostly)\nAndroid cleaning up the memory and unloading stuff to make room (this should be only temporary, but can be very annoying on older devices or with custom ROMs)\n\n\nIf you experience slowdowns, and can't or don't want to uninstall the apps that cause them (or you don't know which ones it is), then a task killer can really make a difference. The same applies for older devices that don't have enough RAM.\n\nSo: it shouldn't be neccessary, but you might try it as a workaround if you have misbehaved apps on your device.\n",

I am using an external SD card which I use to store data (music/pictures/docs/pdf). For cutting/pasting files I use the ES File Explorer app that was supplied with the tablet. I periodically connect it to my laptop via the USB lead to back up the data. After over a years' use I noticed it becoming sluggish and more unstable, so I performed a factory reset and reinstalled/updated the apps I use most. There was a marked improvement.\n\nNow, when I connect to my laptop, and view the external SD card with Windows Explorer prior to backing up, I see that all the folders are shown multiple times (around a dozen or so copies). Looking in these folders, the files icons primarily show as blank - as if the file type is not recognised. It is almost as if these are archived backup versions. Consequently, it takes some time to locate the genuine folder for backup purposes. These duplicate folders do not show up when viewed within Android using ES File Explorer. However, most of the images shown in the Gallery are blank - presumably picking up the file copies. The same occurs when viewing the music files within ES File Explorer - but they cannot be deleted within that app.\n\nAs all the files were backed up, I decided to try deleting the \"archive\" folders within Windows Explorer. Not a success, as only a handful of blank images/videos at all are visible within Gallery, and none at all within ES File Explorer on Android. I note the latter now has a Recycle bin, but I have been emptying this, and I have since tried disabling this option.\n\nSo - my question is, can anybody suggest what is causing these duplicates, and how can I stop it recurring?

Well, that is to say, Android reads the build.prop as it's normal boot process. Once the Connectivity Service runs, it checks to see if net.hostname is set in the Settings, then if empty, then it uses the \"android_\" + (permanent) android ID. So that's all you need to do.\n\nAdd net.hostname=HOSTNAMEHERE to /system/build.prop (Root may be needed). Leave a blank line at the end of the file.\n\nKitkat's ConnectivityService.java, notice the IF isEmpty statement:\n\n    // setup our unique device name\n    if (TextUtils.isEmpty(SystemProperties.get(\"net.hostname\"))) {\n        String id = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(),\n                Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n        if (id != null &amp;&amp; id.length() &gt; 0) {\n            String name = new String(\"android-\").concat(id);\n            SystemProperties.set(\"net.hostname\", name);\n\n\nAndroid 2.3 and Below\n\nOlder versions, Gingerbread, Froyo, etc, just clobber it. It doesn't bother to check. It will set net.hostname to android_24412414... no matter what. So you will need to change it after that Connectivity Service has finished loading. Luckily, it only runs the startup once, not on every new connection. So we just need to run setprop net.hostname HOSTNAMEHERE after that for it to stick. Unfortunately, it runs fairly late in the boot process, so you need something that will make the changes on boot_complete. Most likely an App that runs by itself. \n\nFroyo's ConnectivityService.java:\n\n    // setup our unique device name\n    String id = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(),\n            Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n    if (id != null &amp;&amp; id.length() &gt; 0) {\n        String name = new String(\"android_\").concat(id);\n        SystemProperties.set(\"net.hostname\", name);\n\n\nBut then there is another issue.\n\nThe net.hostname setting, is not copied to the entire system! If you use a console/terminal application, you might not get the same hostname. My phone, a Samsung Sidekick 4G (semi-Galaxy S based) has an init.rc which runs hostname localhost, so all underneath commands will not see either your build.prop hostname or the android_id hostname! So you need to set that too.\n\n\n  hostname HOSTNAMEHERE or echo HOSTNAMEHERE &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hostname\n\n\nNote: Depending on how you are doing it, you'll need to run the above command as root in order for it to work. Init.rc is typically on the read only system partition, so root access is needed to edit it.\n\nThe dhcpcd command, which is run to get a dhcp address, will not update to a hostname provided by the server (That can be fixed by adding the right dhcpcd-run-hooks and dhcpcd.conf), and it will not provide a hostname to the dhcp server if $(hostname) (The hostname command) is blank or localhost, and it does not internally use net.hostname. libnetutils is used for calling dhcpcd with -h \"net.hostname\", but if for some reason it decides not to call with -h, DHCPCD WILL STILL SEND THE SYSTEM HOSTNAME via gethostname(), as long as it's not \"(none)\", \"localhost\", or empty. On Stock Froyo anyway. Samsung screwed the pooch on some devices like mine. No hostname pass through, forced network time, etc.\n\nMy Solution for Gingerbread and below Samsung, Edit the DHCP Client Daemon config:\n\nThe last thing you can do is edit /etc/dhcpcd/dhcpcd.conf. If you add hostname YOURHOSTNAME to the file, it will use that, unless a hostname is given on the commandline. This won't fix the android_234etc issue, but will if the hostname is localhost (My problem, since Samsung screwed libnetutils and localhost in init.rc). You will need Root, but this works across reboots. This won't work if dhcpcd is called with -h Hostname option.\n", 
            "This works on CyanogenMod and probably other modified ROMs but not stock AOSP ROMs:\n\nGo to Settings > Developer Options and scroll down to Device Hostname. Root is not needed.\n\n(Click image to enlarge)\n\n\n"

            "\n  Is there any specific command or script to be put on the flash drive, to acquire image of Android smartphone and store the acquired image to the flash drive On-The-Go?\n\n\nNope. No special command or script is needed other than cat or dd, the binaries thankfully Android comes with.\n\nOften, the auto mount point of a flash drive is /mnt/usbotg (may differ for your device), so the command would be\n\ndd if=/dev/block/BLOCK_DEVICE of=/mnt/usbotg/FILENAME.img\n\n\nReplace BLOCK_DEVICE with the block file's name (the partition you want to copy). It may start with mmcblk. \n\nIf required, see How to list all major partitions with their labels? \n\n\n  How to make it the operation automatically run after the flash drive is inserted? For example: Once i insert the flash drive into Android Smartphone, the dd command run automatically and the acquired image stored to flash drive. (sic)\n\n\nUnless you're planning to inject a BadUSB into the Android device, you would need an automation app. I found Tasker and Automagic suitable for the job. Both are paid apps with free trial version available on their site.\n\nTasker\n\nHere is a simple complete profile:\n\n\nProfile: State &rarr; Hardware USB Connected &rarr;  Mass Storage\nTask: (Actions): \n\n\nCode &rarr; Run Shell:\n\n\nCommand: dd if=/dev/block/BLOCK_DEVICE of=/mnt/usbotg/FILENAME.img\ncheck Use Root\n\n\n\nThis should be enough but I prefer to add some glitters here and there. I would wait for 10 seconds after flash drive is mounted before executing the command. I would also give visual indication to myself that Tasker is running the countdown.\n\nAll of this can be done by following this simple procedure:\n\n\nSet a variable to maximum length of countdown (Variables &rarr; Variable Set)\nWait for 1 second (Task &rarr; Wait)\nSubtract 1 from the remaining of variable (Variables &rarr; Variable Subtract)\nCancel any Tasker notification (Alert &rarr; Notify Cancel)\nGive visual indication of countdown (Alert &rarr; Notify &rarr; include variable in Title or Text)\nRepeat the said steps (exclude variable set) for countdown (Task &rarr; Goto &rarr; Action Number: 2)\nRun the command (Code &rarr; Run Shell)\n\n\n\nThis would work. However, the moment you plug your flash drive into your device, Tasker would seek confirmation whether to continue with this flash drive or not. It can remember the device for future correspondence.\n\nAutomagic\n\nAutomagic would introduce you with a mandatory know-how, so details are not  important here. The basic flow would need:\n\n\nTrigger: Storage Media Event; Event: Mounted\nAction: Execute Root Command &rarr; fill the details\n\n\nActivate the flow and Automagic's service, and test the flow.\n\nThere is one major caveat here. There is no differentiation between the type of storage connected, hence, your flow may trigger if you inject SD card too. \n\nNote: Rather than keeping the command inside the apps, you can keep it under a script and place it in your flash drive. Configure your automation app to confirm whether the script exists in the mounted flash drive and if yes, execute it. For confirmation, Tasker already has Read File action. Else, ls \"YOUR_SCRIPT\" should help. \n"

            "Phone service carriers will sometimes update the firmware on your radio. For reasons unknown, improved radio firmware isn't always made available to customers.\n\nThe radio firmware will, through software, increase your service coverage, giving you better signal and battery life.\n", 
            "The radio firmware controls basic low-level functions like network connectivity, Wi-Fi, and GPS. For several years, though, \"radio\" means \"baseband\", and controls network connectivity aspects only, while WiFi and GPS are governed by OS drivers, like any other devices.\n\nUsually upgrading your radio will not give you any new features but will fix connectivity issues, increase range or performance, decrease battery usage, or the like. Some ROM's require you to have the latest radio versions to work.\n\nWhile a botched radio upgrade can brick your phone, the process is basically the same as upgrading your ROM. Just make sure not to unplug or power down your phone in the middle, make sure you trust the person who released the radio firmware, and try to read some comments or reviews.\n", 
            "As a side note on radio firmwares beware of upgrading them without having seen a test of the version on your network.\n\nSometimes new radio firmwares add features for some network providers that result in worse bandwidth, disconnections and other disagreement if you use them on another network. Network operators don't provide phones with such broken firmwares (they wait for the next version or just provide the same radio firmware forever) but if you install them yourself it's a risk you take.\n\nBut if you want to use the latest firmware all the times before your network operator or phone manufacturer provide the update you may need to take this risk (Video crashed the HTC Desire when used with all but the latest radio rom on froyo...)\n", 
            "If you don't think it is necessary to flash a radio then don't do it. At least I heard that it will not make any difference to your phone storage and speed. But somehow if you have connectivity issues like dropped calls, WiFi connection not searching or GPS does not seem to work then surely you need to flash the radio to another version than you are using at the moment.\n\nIf you want to see which radio your phone is working on go to settings > About phone > Baseband version > See the last some digits and then search for your phone Like HTC desire latest radio etc..  \n\nNote: I Recommend you should read more about Radio before flashing it. Sometimes there is a chance to brick your phone but don't worry if you have searched enough of it you are not going to lose anything.

        "answer": [
            "Note: The solution is tested on Android 4.2.1, 5.0.2 and 5.1.1.\n\n\n\nThe value for the system property persist.sys.safemode  determines whether the phone should boot into safe mode or in normal mode. \n\nWhen booted into Android OS, provided root access, the value can be changed as\n\nadb shell su -c 'setprop persist.sys.safemode 1'\nadb shell su -c 'echo \"1\" &gt; /data/property/persist.sys.safemode' #alternative \n\n\nWhen booted into a custom recovery, given the data and optionally, system partition are mounted, do\n\nadb shell busybox printf \"1\" &gt; /data/property/persist.sys.safemode         #works if recovery has Busybox. If Android OS has busybox then system/xbin/busybox would work\nadb shell echo \"1\" &gt; /data/property/persist.sys.safemode                   #alternative\nadb shell chmod 600 /data/property/persist.sys.safemode                    #required; changes the permission of file to rw-------, identical to rest of the files under /data/property\n\n\nIt is to be noted that, if you've never booted into safe mode since last factory reset, the file persist.sys.safemode wouldn't be found. \n\nAndroid resets the content of  said file at every reboot, so you need not to worry about getting stuck at safe mode. However, for the purpose of fail-safe requirement, change the value to 0 or empty the file (NULL), should you ever get stuck. \n\nIn a nutshell, the property that you set is stored in a file, hence it remains persistent when you shutdown the device. You can see your value inside the file from recovery mode, provided that you've not booted into Android again after editing the property. Now, once you begin to boot into Android OS, Android et al reads the file, and based on the content, prepares the safe/ordinary mode for you. After reading the file, it resets the content of the file, so the next time you reboot, it would always be in ordinary mode. \n\nI, in my experiments, noticed that Android would boot into safe mode even if the value is any positive or negative integer or even a decimal value. \n\nI got a good hint from source code of ShutdownThread.java that safe mode requires a system property to be set. However, I reached the final conclusion using a comment by pylerSM and a post from ZiT777.\n"

Android 4.1 brought in a new security model around logfiles that meant that apps could only read their own logfiles and logfile entries, and can't read logfile entries written by the system or other apps.\n\nThere is however still both a way for an app's user to generate a logfile of the app's recent log entries to be sent to a developer, and for a phone's owner to grant permissions to allow an app to read the logfile without full root, but this does require you to use an ADB command, which unfortunately takes it out of the reach of most normal phone users:\n\n\n  If you want the user to give you debugging information, you can have\n  them generate a bug report with power + volume down + volume up which\n  includes the logs and lots of other data, and automatically brings up\n  their e-mail app to sent it all (plus a screenshot).  We were just\n  discussing that we should have an easier way to generate these as\n  well, I am going to look at adding something to the settings app.\n  \n  I also have started introducing the concept of a \"development\"\n  permission, which read logs is classified as.  This allows the app to\n  request the permission, but not get it at install.  You can however\n  grant it with an adb shell command once it is installed.  At some\n  point later I expect to have a UI in the system for doing this, but we\n  are going to hold off on that to be careful about how we present this.\n\n\nExcerpt from a post on Google Groups by Dianne Hackborn, Android Framework Engineer. My emphasis.\n\nThe mentioned ADB command to grant an application permission to read the logs is:\n\nadb shell pm grant &lt;pkg&gt; android.permission.READ_LOGS\n\n\nThis setting should survive reboots and upgrades of the app (but not uninstalls/reinstalls).\n",

If an app is starting automatically it's because it needs to. Well-designed apps that may or may not really need to run automatically will have an option in their settings to turn that on or off.\n\nNote that unlike your PC, having extra RAM doesn't improve performance so much. It's better for your often used apps to already be in RAM when you launch them, so that they don't need to be loaded. Running with little to no free RAM is a good thing on Android, and the OS does a good job of killing things it doesn't need any more.\n",

Otherwise you are going to waste performance/battery because when you kill a task it is going to re-spawn back up.  And if you  killed a task that was writing to disk (or a database), then you could potentially create corruption.\n\nThe only time you ever, ever, ever should kill a task is if it is obviously running wild or hung up (and usually when this happens you get the Force Close screen.  If not, go to Settings --> Applications --> find your app and kill the task there).\n",

Android manages resources intelligently, and will kill applications when other applications need to use memory, and resurrect them later to restore service. Unlike some other phones, which sacrifices basic smartphone functionality, like multitasking, by only allowing one running application at a time).\n\nAs for how Android determine how to resurrect apps, it's mainly determined by Intents. Applications can register to be notified by the OS when certain events occur, e.g. the phone starting up, you're entering a particular location, the wifi gets turned on, etc. When handling notifications (Intents), the application (or parts of it) may get resurrected. In a sense, conceptually in Android, all installed applications are always running all the time and you have conceptually infinite memory.

This means they will allow the app to load, and then kill it. This means that extra battery power is used to kill the app, and then it will probably be reloaded on some event trigger later, only to be killed again. \n\nHonestly, if you use these apps, and don't want to uninstall them, the best thing is to just let them load. They will use a bit of memory, as long as there is some that isn't being used. As soon as something needs the memory, then the system will kill the app - and believe me the Android system has a better idea of which tasks to kill than any dumb task killer. \n\nThere is a good description about why task killers are a bad idea here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=6426198#post6426198\n\nOtherwise, there is no way to do this on an unrooted phone, unless the app specifically gives an option to disable auto-startup. On a rooted phone, however, there are a range of apps that are able to actually change the way broadcast intents are delivered to apps, meaning they can pre-emptively be prevented from starting.\n\nTo be honest I struggle to think of a reason that an app might want to load a service at startup, that it couldn't achieve by just registering a broadcast listener. Services should typically be used for background tasks that have a limited lifetime. Some apps may load a service at startup to do some processing, but will then typically close it once that processing is complete.\n\nHowever, that said, not all developers understand the rules.

            "TLDR: use a SIM with a different number (no matter if Vodafone or a different service).\n\nWe see a symptom (no net), but we have to find out the cause first, to solve the problem. So let's think step by step, what the problem could be.\n\n\nFaulty phone?\nNo, your other phone (the SII) doesn't work either (using the same SIM).*\nFaulty SIM?\nNo, you have already tried a new SIM.\nFaulty cellular tower?\nNo, you have already tried an other tower (by changing location).\nFaulty Vodafone?\nLikely, because I'm sure they have net, and you're sure that they have to give you net (data limit hadn't been reached), plus we've found out in the previous questions that it isn't about the net is stuck between you and them. The only problem here is that you have already asked them, so they should have investigated the issue. But I'm sure they will take a next - more in-depth - look, since all the other possibilites are crossed out now.\n\n\nI advise you to call Vodafone again, tell them that your phone is ok, your SIM is ok, the local tower is ok, your data subscription is ok, and then there is nothing left to do: they have to accept the fact that there is something wrong with their service. Until that, use a SIM with a different number, I'm sure it'll work in your current phone.\n\n* To be 100% that your phone is ok, try a different SIM with a different number. I think the new number can still be Vodafone, because only your current account is affected (your current number), not the whole infrastructure. However, if you don't want to experiment (and your phone is unlocked), you can immediately get a SIM from an other company, as Firelord suggested in a comment below. (So that you are safe, even if the whole Vodafone system is damaged.)\n",

These are 20 AWG thickness for charging (provide best charging) 28 AWG for data (thinner thickness doesn't affect data transfer speeds). Picture below from product \n\n\n\nPerformance: I have two devices Samsung Note 2 and Huawei Honor 6 both with OEM chargers and OEM cables (nearly a year old).

Former are comparatively brittle and have lower conductivity compared to Copper conductors\n\n\n\nStandards\n\n\nUSB standard 3.0 in   lays down standards of 10\u00a0W: 5\u00a0V, 2\u00a0A\u00a0 for smartphones and tablets\nBattery Charging Revision 1.2 lays down \" standard for establishing the proper way to charge a battery from a USB port \"\nAmerican Wire Gauge\u00a0(AWG) is a reference for thickness of cables. In this system,\u00a0larger numbers indicate thinner wires. USB specification above makes reference to AWG numbers of 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28, \n\n\nThese standards are to ensure that appropriate Voltage and Current are available to the device being charged and selection of  right USB cable is based on these to deliver right amount of Power to charge\n\n\n\nThis is applicable for all Android phones- OP's device is taken as an example ( see Notes at end )\n\nAll USB cables are NOT the same when it comes to charging\n\nSelection of USB cables depends on:\n\n\nDevice it is meant to charge\nLength of cable\nThickness of cable in AWG ( externally, they may look the same but what matters is the electrical conductor thickness internally ). USB cables of standard make are marked showing the thickness, for example,\n\n28AWG/2C and 24AWG/2C or 28AWG/1P + 24AWG/2C\n\n\nThis means\n\n\n  The first code is normally the specification of the data signal pair, which is normally 28AWG. \"2C\" means 2 conductors, and \"1P\" or \"1Pr\" means 1 pair. \"2C\" and \"1P\" are basically the same.\n  \n  The important part is the second code, which is the specification of the power distribution pair (relevant to the solution here) \n\n\nBefore we get into details of how to select based on these factors, a quick recap of  basic electrify would help:\n\nOhm's Law  Current = Voltage divided by Resistance\n\nResistance = Length  of cable divided by Area of cable (ignoring resistivity)\n\nPower = Voltage multiplied by Current\n\n\nWhat do those equations mean?\n\nCurrent carrying capacity depends on resistance, for the same Voltage.\n\nResistance is inversely proportional to the area of the wire ( Less area = Thinner Wire = More Resistance = Less Current )\n\nResistance is directly proportional to length (Longer cable = More resistance and vice versa )\n\nPower in turn is therefore dependent on length and thickness of cable (affecting resistance) and Voltage\n\nIn a nut shell, quoting from USB Cable Resistance: Why your phone/tablet might be charging slow\n\n\n  if you are going to replace your cable with an aftermarket cable, it would be best to see if you can find a cable with the thickest possible conductors for the power. If that isn\u2019t possible,\u00a0stick with short (to very short) lengths, as that always works.\n\n\nPower (Voltage times Current), thickness, short lengths are qualitative and need to be in numbers to choose the right cable. For this you need to know, firstly, Power-  Refers to the charger rating of your device .  Your device as mentioned is \"incredible\" and  Charger for HTC Droid Incredible shows it to be rated for 1A\n\nNext, is Voltage- For a\u00a05V output, the USB specification demands that the voltage remains within 5% (i.e. an acceptable voltage drop of 0.25V). Some vendors provide a slightly higher Voltage rating\n\n\n  .... some vendors have realized the issue (of Voltage drop ) and decided to push the output voltage up to 5.1v or 5.2v, which is still within USB specification but allows for an extra 0.1-0.2v voltage drop. This is a potentially nice feature as it means the requirements on the cables are slightly relaxed (i.e. maybe even 0.7v voltage drop is tolerable).\n\n\nChoosing the right cable\n\nYou know the Power and Voltage , only thing left is to know the thickness and length of USB cable. For that refer to the tables (choose under the current rating of table With Contact Resistance, which is real life, without contact resistance is to give the effect of cable alone) and look for maximum cable length / thickness combinations by choosing \"non red\" color (green or yellow) which tell you that you can safely choose, as indicated by arrows:\n\n\n24 AWG cable upto 2 metres in length\n26 AWG cable upto 1 metres in length\n\n\n\n\nGoogle for this cable specs (normally cables are commonly sold as 24/28 AWG ,in  which case select maximum 1 meter length ) and buy from a reputed vendor. Done!!\n\nNotes\n\n\nYou can calculate the voltage drop using Ohm's law yourself. Tables are for convenience. Helpful pointers on using the tables :\n\n\nIf the exact rating of your charger is  not available, say 1.35 A, select the next higher rating or work it out issuing Ohm's law\nGreen color in table indicates, that the values are compliant to USB standard.\nYellow While yellow-zone figures are not going to be strictly compliant with the USB -0.25V maximum drop, it may still be sufficient for a full charge as many devices can accept somewhat more loss of voltage without detriment to charging\nRed Non compliant to standards. Don't use\nFor lower current rating upto 1.5 A, selection of yellow zone lengths may still be sufficient for a full charge as many devices can accept somewhat more loss of voltage without detriment to charging. For higher currents (more than 1.5V), you need to be more conservative, so you should choose towards the green.\n\nFor Tablet users: you need to choose what falls in \"green\" zone only, since Voltage drop sensitivity is higher. See this as an example Google Nexus 7 Charging\nI am in no way affiliated with the source and I believe it to be credible given the detailed logic presented and relates well with other sources which recommend short cables, without proper justification.

Ultimately I had to reboot the phone to get it to be usable again.  This happened when I really needed to make a call and was a huge hassle.  Having a smart phone with tons of data network features is great, but I still pay more for minutes than I do for data (thank you US carriers...) so not having it function as a phone when I need it is very frustrating.\n\nI'm running Android 2.2 and don't use many widgets nor do I keep many programs running that use background services (don't usually keep GTalk connected, etc)\n\nDoes anyone have any general tips or apps to avoid to help keep my phone stable and reliable?\n",

            "Well, it sounds like you don't want to monkey much. (Otherwise I'd recommend rooting and then installing vanilla 2.2, which is going to be the most stable of any release). It sounds like the problem you experienced is just a flat out bug and might not have anything to do with any apps you are running. \n\nOn the other hand, are you using any task-killing apps, or battery saving apps or anything that might be screwing around with system processes? If you are, I would recommend getting rid of them -- they are generally cause more problems in the long-run than they solve. If not, then I'm not sure what to tell you other than file a bug report or call Verizon and complain, but neither of these options will fix your problem. \n\nIf the problem was at root a signal issue, there is a way to update cell tower information, which Verizon can help you with. It involves dialing a number and allowing an automatic update.\n\nBUT, if you did want to monkey a bit, then I do suggest flashing the vanilla froyo. It is just a little intensive, but wouldn't take you longer than an hour. If you want information in this regard, I can provide you with a website that includes step by step instructions.\n",

Some of these have to run as a background service to function\n\n\nOn another note, I have found that if I am in an area where the signal is poor (or I guess in this case where the phone thinks the signal is poor) not only does my battery get used up faster, but it seems to slow my phone down.

            "I use AppBrain because it provides a nice site, and it makes it really easy to install apps onto my phone.  Additionally, I'm finding that many bloggers that are reviewing apps are putting links to the AppBrain page for the app in their posts.  This makes it really easy to mark something for install while I'm at my computer reading the blog posts, and then install it when I get a chance.\n\n\n\nEdit by Izzy:\n\nAppBrain offers an alternative (and much cleaner) interface to the Google Play Store, which offers several advantages:\n\n\nsearch results are much less limited (30 pages \u00e0 10 apps = 300 results, much more than Play offers)\nsearch results \"gray out\" possible spam, offensive, and otherwise harmful apps. You still can see them, though \u2013 but it's quite clear what to skip\napp details page gives the most important details at a glance. It's easy to see what permissions are requested. And if those form \"potential dangerous combinations\" (called \"concerns\" at AppBrain), that's automatically pointed out by a warning sign on the permissions tab\nTheir app (an alternative to the Playstore app) enables you to skip single (or all) updates on a per-app-base, which keeps your list of \"pending updates\" quite clean.\n\n\nFor installation, you will be redirected to Google Play. In the past, AppBrain had a separate app for this called the \"Fast Web Installer\", but unfortunately this app was banned by Google. So even for batch updates, the Playstore app will now be opened for each app separately (not AppBrains fault).\n\n  \nAppBrain App Market (source: AppBrain; click images for larger variants)\n\nStill, I count their Website as a much better alternative to the Google Play website \u2013 and the same is to be said for their app, though for installations it has to redirect you as described above.\n",

Most (all?) of the markets nowadays offer both, via a dedicated phone-app that you'll have to install, except from the official one which is already there.\n\nUntil, well, yesterday, the 'official' market would not have been available from your PC (meaning: on a PC web browser). Now it is, with a neat push-to-your-phone one click installation that is taking away one of the advantages of the competition (see AppBrain). The alternative markets, though, have still their peculiarities. I'll make a short summary but don't expect it to highlight all of the differences. Some markets (e.g. AndSpot) do not offer very specific features to users, but try to gather developers by offering advanced features such as easy stats.\n\n\nAmazon AppStore: latest big entry. countries limitations; catalog looking very promising with some (exclusive?) good pay-for apps; also features special offers and daily freebies.

It's a meta-store (my favourite before the official market update)\nAPKPure: don't need any registration to use it\nSlideME: they provide applications to niche markets, based on geographic location, payment method or even types of applications that users can't find in traditional channels\nSamsung Apps (must be installed on Samsung Galaxy devices, or else you can't use this): Samsung app store, which of course requires you to own a Samsung Android device\nF-Droid they distribute FOSS open source packages that pass audit and verification to ensure that code have no malicious parts.\nGetJar: my latest discovery. Quite a lot of apps, and they have specials (\"GOLD\") commercial apps for free. Extremely interesting platform for developers, since they seem to offer above-the-average marketing and PS activities!\nTorrApk: it's free and it distributes only free Android apps through their apk files.

            "I've been using F-Droid, which is a smallish repository focused on free and open source tools. Not all encompassing by any means but one of the few that is explicit about showing you the license before you download an app.\n\n\n\nEdit by Izzy:\n\nF-Droid is a small, but superb alternative to Google Play. Though it offers only about 1.200 apps1 in its main repository, they are mostly high quality. In comparision, these are some advantages it has over the Playstore:\n\n\nApps are OpenSource, which means they are all free (to support the devs, there are donation buttons on each apps page)\nF-Droid compiles the packages from the sources. This adds a level of security, as it makes sure nothing was \"sneaked into\". The draw-back is, you cannot simply cross-update apps between the F-Droid main repo and other sources.\nCompiling the sources themselves, they also often throw out \"binary blobs\" and other unfree material (i.e. included modules from proprietary sources). In many cases, this means the advertisement stuff being removed. This again increases security (and privacy). But in some cases it has the draw-back of some functionality being broken, if the removed part was e.g. stuff enabling specific Google services, such as maps.\nNext to its main repository, F-Droid offers several others2. Developers can provide their own \"channel\", e.g. for Beta versions. A nice way also for companies or organizations to keep together groups of apps their members are supposed to use.\nF-Droid is very clear when it comes to \"anti-features\" such as ads. If an app in any way deviates from the OpenSource idea, that's pointed out straight in colored boxes you can't miss when browsing the apps pages. Quoting bgvaughan from the comments:  \n\n\n  f-droid's Preferences allow you to screen apps by various traits: whether they contain advertising, track your activity, or promote non-free add-ons, among others. While I miss the lack of user ratings on f-droid, and f-droid app versions sometimes trail behind those on Google Play, the fact that I can be sure that anything on f-droid is free, open-source, and not a freaking PITA, is more than enough to recommend its use.  \n\n\nI can also only approve what Nicolas says about F-Droid in his comment:  \n\n\n  F-Droid apps are guaranteed open source, ad-free, tracking-free. That means smaller apps that don't waste your bandwidth for anti-features.\n\n\n\nF-Droid also offers its own Android client, the F-Droid Application Manager:\n\n\nF-Droid App (source: AndroidNext; click for larger variant)\n\nMore details on F-Droid can also be found at Wikipedia.

            "Missing in previous answers is AndroidPIT which is running a separate market. Sure, almost all apps found there are also in the Playstore (but not necessarily vice-versa: so for missing apps there are links to the playstore provided). Developers need to actively maintain their apps on this platform (i.e. upload new versions), and for paid apps AndroidPIT provides its own license API.\n\nSo what is the plus of this platform? It has an active community (in the forums and the news blogs), and one can use alternative payment methods (e.g. Paypal) in addition to credit cards. Moreover, reviews for apps can be found there as well. So with the playstore comments, local comments, and the reviews, one can get a better idea of what an app is like -- before downloading it. Furthermore, the German branch even has an App Reviews section in their forum, including overviews for apps on a kind of \"per-category\" base -- which makes it easier to find a suiting app, as similar apps are grouped together.\n\nSo if you like that idea, but do not want another \"source of apps\" (it's a good idea to stick to one market platform, especially for paid apps -- so you don't lose track which app you installed from what source, and get into trouble on a re-install for a new (or factory-reset) device), you can still go there for information.\n\nUPDATE: AndroidPIT will close its independent app market on 2014-12-31.\n",

Paulo Trezentos, co-founder of Aptoide, kindly pointed out several details behind Aptoide in his answer on How safe is it to use Aptoide? And even more in a mail he sent to me. Some core-points:\n\n\nLike Google Play, Aptoide actively scans its repositories for malware. They're using 3 different malware scanners, doing signature checks, and having implemented a chain-of-trust based in the signature of the developers.\nThey work with several universities and research centers to make and keep the environment as safe as possible.\nThey use a \"trust stamp\" to mark apps they've thoroughly checked (see 1000contest). If you see that on the page for an app, you can consider it 99.9% safe (according to Paulo).1\n\nPrivacy is considered a high value. Aptoide is very cautious about the way they internally handle the user\u2019s private information.\nTheir \u201cApps\u201d store is manually curated. So when looking for a way to stay as safe as possible with all those hundred-thousands of repositories, this would be the place (all the app links in this post point there). But even towards all the other repos, Paulo states:\n\n\n  we have a responsibility to assure that the apps in those stores do not harm the end user.\n  \n  In his mail to me, Paulo concluded: Believe we still can do better. Which to me indicates they don't settle on what they have achieved, but try to continually improve. If you additionally consider there's a company behind the \"stores\" which recently even filed an antitrust complaint against Google, that should be sufficient to deviate from associating Aptoide with \"black markets\" and \"piracy\" any more than Youtube \u2013 but rather consider it a good alternative (or supplement) to other Android app markets.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some more advantages worth mentioning:\n\n\nyou can have your own repository there \u2013 whether private or public. Their Aptoide Uploader helps you upload your apps there.\nyou can use a private repository to automatically backup your apps. Their Aptoide Backup Apps is your helper for that.\nyou can schedule installs/updates. Comes in handy when you're e.g. on mobile data, and just found a bigger app you'd prefer installing on WiFi. Just mark it, and when on WiFi toggle the \"scheduled installs\" (see third screenshot above).\n\n\nTry that with Google Play :)\n\n\n\n1 Example of untrusted app detection:\n\n\nAptoide warns an application might be malicious (source: Aptoide; click image for larger variant)\n\nA couple of things to see here:\n\n\nThe little yellow exclamation mark with the red \"Warning\" title is visible immediately; details below are displayed when \"show\" was clicked\n3 anti-malware-checks have been run against this package, one of them the Aptoide specific malware guard\nthe signature was found suspicious for multiple reasons:\n\nit is not known to Aptoide as a \"trusted signature\" (Aptoide maintains a \"chain of trust\" for signatures, comparable to PGP/GPG)\nit was used elsewhere to sign another developers package (and moreover, that developers signature was known to Aptoide, so that was a \"re-sign\" possibly introducing a hack of some kind)\n\nsome information on the Anti-Malware checks is included at the end of the box\n\n"

If it is garbage collection, you will likely only see the delay when other apps have been recently running and then switching immediately the misbehaving app.  You can completely uninstall an app, including user data, and then re-install to see if it has something to do with your personal settings.\n"

            "Short answer\n\nNo.\n\nSome background\n\nAs you can have multiple devices associated with the same account (even if they're all of the same brand and model) and still target them separately, there must be an identifier. Logical conclusion is that identifier being the GSF1 android_id. When you register your \"replacement\", a new android_id will be created for your specific installation2, and stored with the device's configuration. This serves as device identifier for all related operations/interactions between your device and Google services, e.g. for GCM3 and Google Play (apps).\n\nHence I'd say it's safe to assume the same is used by ADM4, as it's part of Google Services as well. So as long as you don't restore a full backup of your old device, but register e.g. via the setup assistant, your replacement will get a new android_id and thus not receive the \"wipe request\" addressed at a different android_id.\n\nAnother proof to that I've just found on Reddit: Someone had setup multiple devices using the same Nandroid backup taken from a fully configured device, and hence with the same android_id. Result was ADM seeing them all as one device, always \"communicating\" with the last-used device.5 The issue was solved by resetting the ID.\n\nReferences for further investigation\n\n\nXDA: What is the Android Device-ID?\nSO: GSF ID KEY (google service framework id) as Android device unique identifier\nReddit: Multiple devices with the same android ID\n\n\n\n\n1: Google Services Framework\n2: This is done whenever you register a device, i.e. associate it with your Google account\n3: Google Cloud Messaging, e.g. used in the SE app to notify you that you've been mentioned or got an answer to your questions\n4: Android Device Manager\n5: Quote: it seems like the last device booted is recognized online, the other one isn't\n"

        "answer": [
            "To 'root' your phone means to gain administrative rights on the file system of your phone (in linux, root is the username of the master admin).  With root access, you can install and uninstall anything you want on the phone.\n\nMost phones come with limited access regarding what you can and can't do on it.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because it can keep users from accidentally breaking something they shouldn't mess with on the phone, especially in regards to the operating system.  However, many manufacturers limit your rights to things that aren't really so mission critical, too, and rooting the phone gets around this.\n\nIf you have a few unnecessary applications (bloatware) pre-installed on your phone that you cannot uninstall, rooting will give you this ability.  It will also allow you to upgrade to newer versions of Android before your phone's manufacturer and/or cell provider make the updates available to you.  Be warned, though, that rooting may void your warranty.\n\nFor more info on what rooting enables you to do with your phone, check out this question.\n", 
            "To gain root (administrator) access to a phone.\n\n'root' is the user with UID 0, which is the equivalent of a full 'System Administration Account'.\n\nIt means you have the permission to do anything.\nAnything includes opening protected ports (for example for WiFi-tethering), update and upgrade the OS and all software, replace the operating system with your own software, full access to every file on the machine, and the ability to delete any file, including the entire operating system.\n", 
            "When you \"root\" your phone you are unlocking the administrative privileges of the phone which by default are locked by the manufacturer.  It's similar to \"Jailbreaking\" in the iphone world.\n\nRooting your device allows you to do things like overclock or underclock your CPU, delete those preloaded apps that your phone wont delete like Amazon MP3 or Corp Calendar, install certain apps that require root access, load custom ROMs...\n\nThe manufacturers don't want you to have access to these options for a number of reasons including but not limited to:\n\n\nThey want to control and ensure a specific user experience\nCertain carriers require that certain functions are locked out because they want you to pay for them or because they are incompatible with their network\nIf you don't know what you are doing you can \"brick\" (render useless) your phone or at least cause enough problems where you'll be calling tech support demanding to know why your phone doesn't work.\n\n", 
            "In short, it means to get administrator access to the phone.  To do things that a normal (non-administrator) user of the phone cannot do.\n", 
            "The above answers are already correct, but just for a bit of nerd reference. In all Unix based systems there is a \"root\" user who has access to any and all functions available by the operating system. This is a very powerful (and dangerous) privilege because once you are root you can do anything and much of what you can do can completely destroy the system. \n\nThis is why when you administer a server you usually don't do it as root, so that you can take advantage of the operating system saying \"umm... you don't want to do THAT!\" when you accidentally ask it to wipe clean the entire hard drive at 3am.\n\n[EDIT] I was going to modify my answer to say \"In the other answers\" but then realized that the effect this would have would be to render the comments beneath (assuming they're still there) nonsensical. \n\nI'm not seeing a strike-through in the text editor, so, I'll just amend here that I should have said \"In the other answers\" rather than \"In the above answers\". \n", 
            "This is a bit of an amendment to everything. Essencially Rooting is Jailbreaking. You are a user, you don't have administrator access to your own phone. Rooting is the process of getting access to the \"root\" user. Once you have root, there are some fun things you can do.\n\n\nRemove \"system\" apps like Sprint's Nascar or NFL apps.\nUse tools like Open Tethering to do wifi tethering (for free)\nUnderclock or Overclock your processor (underclocking with SetCPU helps keep battery usage up while not really affecting performance when your phone is in idle/etc.)\nInstall a custom recovery tool.\n\nNandroid Backup -- A complete dump of your android's internal memory to the SD card which allows you to do a very clean backup and literally roll your android back to that point when needed. Also allows you to swap operating systems in minutes by having 2 backups, 1 of each.\n\n\n\nRecently rooting is getting more efficient and with 1-click rooting coming up, it should be a breeze for most people, just set up and let it run for a half an hr.\n\nThe only risk is bricking your phone (screwing up some critical software thus making it impossible to start it up or install a fix).\n", 
            "This question is one of the most viewed on this site, yet all answers say the same: \"getting admin rights, let's you do stuff like xyz and abc\". The latter is not really part of a relevant answer, and indeed there is already a question here: what can a rooted phone do?.\n\nSure rooting equals getting admin rights, but let's add some more details: how admin rights are implemented in Android. Whats happens, on a technical level, when you root a phone? A new program/applet becomes available: su. It sits in the /system/xbin/ folder and allows users to switch to a different user ID --including root (aka admin).\n\nRemember that in android applications normally run under their own user ID. So if 1) su exists and 2) an app uses it to change to root, then the app can do anything the root user could do! \n\nNot all rooting methods produce the same change. For example many methods rely on an additional app called superuser.apk that has a custom version of the su binary. This lets the app act as a permission control manager whenever su is invoked by an app. \n\nIn addition to su and superuser (or SuperSu), often busybox gets installed as part of the rooting script. These three files (technically busybox is a set of files) are the most common additions when we talk about rooting a phone.\n\n\n\nIt is not trivial to just copy a su to the folder yourself, as the /system partition is mounted read only and you need root rights to (re)mount it as writable (and you'd need write permissions if it was). \n\nOne 'indirect' way of doing this is using a recovery with extended functionality, it can mount /system as writable and copy files to it. In most cases this means flashing a custom recovery, as many stock recoveries are limited to patching only specific (OEM) files.\n\nA more 'direct' way would be to directly flash a new /system partition (with root files) using some flashing tool. Such tools include:\n\n\nodin(PC--Samsung only)\nfastboot(PC--Generic Android)\nflashify(app--Generic Android)\n\n\nIt is relatively easy to copy the /system partition from your phone--or an image file from the web, and flash the root-modified partition back. Lastly you may be able to get a root shell using ADB, if the ROM was compiled to allow it (not common in stock ROMs). Using the root shell it is trivial to remount partitions and copy files anywhere you want--if you know linux commands.\n\nThese simple methods work for phones that are unlocked/easy to unlock. When a bootloader is locked the process of rooting can become a convoluted process that may differ between devices, see more specific rooting info here.\nThis is because any custom modifications to important partitions will break the OEM 'signature' and cause the bootloader to refuse loading (bootloop). Or, in some cases the bootloader will just undo any changes.\n"

For me it looks like the apps didn't have the permission to write to the internal storage. For some reason downloading apps from the Google Play Store works. I downloaded \"Root Browser\" and it shows me, that my whole /storage/emulated/0/ is owned by root:root and has rwxrwx--x permissions (the subdirectories too) what seems a little bit strange for me (is that normal?), but I'm not able to change them (Root Browser says that you can't change permissions on some file systems). \nI already searched for this problem, but I didn't find anything. \nI hope someone can help me with this.\n",

The nobis draws 8 to 10 watts from the wall outlet. the droid mini and asus can only pull 3 watts from the same charger and cord. the asus is only a few weeks old while the droid and nobis are a about a year old.\n\nWhat is the reason for the difference in power draw? the droid came with a 2 amp charger. Is there anything I can do to make the droid and asus draw more power and charge faster?\n\nAdditional information:\n\nI believe the problem may be that the Droid Mini and Asus may think they are connected to a computer.\n", 
        "answer": [
            "Short Answer\n\n\nDevices mentioned have different battery capacities. They are meant to be charged with different rated current and therefore different power ( Asus device is 3950 mAh, Nobis is 2500 mAh, Droid Mini 2130 mAh capacity). \nOEM proprietary charging methodology  can also significantly vary current. For instance, Note 2 charging current is 1600 mAh while Xperia charging current is around 600 mAh for similar size battery\nYou can force higher current for faster charging but not advisable (unless OEM offers a way)\nWhat you can do to ensure rated current is delivered is covered\n\n\nLong Answer\n\nI do not know how you are measuring power in watts directly , but power is given by this equation (ignoring power factor or efficiency of charging)\n\nP (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) x Current (Amps) (or corresponding milli units)\n\n\n  Reasons for difference in power drawn\n\n\nVoltage supplied by a standard USB wall charger is 5V. That leaves us only current to be varied to obtain varying power\n\n\nTypically, current drawn by the charger is dependent on \n\n\na) Charging Rate Charging rate is a measure that governs at what current a battery is charged and discharged. At 1C, a battery rated 1,000mAh charges at a current of 1,000mAh. In an ideal world the battery would be fully charged in 60 minutes. At 1C, the same battery discharges at 1,000mA. Ideal charging rate is accepted to be around 0.5 to ,0.8 C for maximum battery life (battery life is measured in discharge cycles). This rate is decided by the OEM and coded in the charging algorithm implanted on ROM and varies\n\nb)  Battery Capacity (mAh) or size as commonly referred. Charging rate is varied dependent on this by OEM. Battery capacity of your Asus device is 3950 mAh, Nobis is 2500 mAh, Droid Mini 2130 mAh \n\nc) Battery Type  Not really relevant since most mobile devices and tablets use Li-Ion or Li-Po batteries\n\n\nLi-Ion or Li-Po charging When you charge a battery at charging rate decided by OEM, it goes through four stages of charging (Constant Current Charge,Saturation Charge and Ready No Current and Ready), see Figure 1 of BU-409 Charging Li-Ion. As you can see from graph voltage and current vary so if you are measuring current using an app like Ampere and derive wattage from current reading, you could end up in wrong comparison if you are not measuring in the same stage of charging\nOEM proprietary charging methodology can also significantly vary current. For instance, Note 2 charging current is 1600 mAh while Xperia charging current is around 600 mAh for similar size battery\n\n\nYou are comparing  Power between Asus (3950 mAh), Nobis (2500 mAh), Droid Mini (2130 mAh), which by itself is not an apple to apple comparison and in conjunction with factors above\n\nDroid and Asus power drawn is similar owing to capacity of battery being similar, whereas Nobis capacity is nearly double compared to Droid,so it seems fine and there is no need to \"force\" more current to be drawn. Doing so will result in poor battery performance. Simply put, forcing the battery to charge faster by increasing the current will result in a battery that discharges faster.  This is covered in my answer and in the Battery University link above\n\nHowever, to answer your question\n\n\n  How do I increase power drawn?\n\n\n\nUsing apps from play store which claim to charge faster\nUsing \"fast chargers\"\nBy flashing a kernel which permit you to alter charging current, if your device is rooted\n\n\n** I do not recommend options 1 and 2 for reasons mentioned in my answer. Option 3 is safer by comparison but needs to be cautiously tweaked and you need to understand the risks.\n\n\n  How to ensure getting maximum (rated) current\n\n\n\nDon't use power intensive apps  while charging. Reasons\nGet the right combination of chargers and charging cables by measuring current with Ampere or 3C Battery Monitor Widget to rule out charger cable problems resulting in low charging current.\nIf you are replacing charger cable, go in for a shorter thicker cable (24/ 28 awg) rather than longer, thinner cables as the former offer less resistance to current\nCleaning the charging port of your device by blow drying it to dislodge lint or dirt that does accumulate when your phone is in pocket or outdoor usage (they cause poor connection and increase resistance )\n\n"

            "Note: \n\n\nParts of this answer didn't work for OP, but nevertheless, they worked in all of my test cases with different ROMs, hence, the answer  would certainly prove to be useful for some users.\nDevice should have a custom recovery installed.\nadb should be setup in PC and USB debugging be enabled and authorized in the device.\nAnything mentioned next to # anywhere in a line is a comment.\n\n\n\n\nMore or less, the changed DPI value would either be in settings.db, /data/property/persist.sys.lcd_density, /system/build.prop or in memory only. I've covered instructions for all of these cases and they should prove to be helpful when the device gets stuck at boot animation. \n\n\nIf it is an Xposed module which changed the DPI and caused boot issue, then try disabling the module or the framework, or, remove the former or both. See my answer here for more info on that.\nIf you used command-line to change DPI (am/wm), then when the device gets stuck at boot animation (past the OEM logo), execute \n\nadb shell am display-density reset    # For Android 4.2.x\nadb shell wm density reset            # For Android 4.3.x and above\nadb reboot\n\nIn my Android 4.2.1, custom display density is saved as a value for the key display_density_forced in the table global of /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db. If you've used command-line (am) or an app used this key, follow these steps:\n\n\nWhen booted into recovery, mount data partition, pull the said file into PC and use an sqlite editor to either remove the key or change the value to a better or default DPI. After that, push the file back to its place.\n\nadb pull /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db LOCAL_PATH     # to pull the file into PC\nadb push LOCAL_PATH/settings.db /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/    # to push the file into Android\nadb reboot \n\n\nReplace LOCAL_PATH with the directory under which settings.db is to be saved and is saved, respectively.\n\n\nIn Android 4.3 and above, custom display density can be found under /data/property/persist.sys.lcd_density or by executing adb shell \"getprop | grep density\". If you used command line (wm) or an app used that property to change DPI then follow these steps:\n\n\nWhen booted into recovery, mount data partition and do\n\nadb shell rm /data/property/persist.sys.lcd_density                      # this will cause Android to fall back to default DPI\nadb shell busybox printf \"DPI\" &gt; /data/property/persist.sys.lcd_density  # change DPI with your custom DPI value\nadb reboot\n\n\nFinally, the easiest but a dangerous and extreme approach you or an app would take is to change the DPI for the key ro.sf.lcd_density inside /system/build.prop. The DPI in the said file is considered the stock DPI of that ROM.\n\nWhen booted into recovery with data partition mounted,\n\n\nYou can choose to override the stock DPI by doing\n\n# replace DPI with your custom DPI\nadb shell am display-density DPI   # For Android 4.2.x only \nadb shell wm density DPI           # For Android 4.3.x and above only \nadb reboot\n\nIf that doesn't work for some reason, do\n\nadb shell sed -i 's/.*ro.sf.lcd_density.*/ro.sf.lcd_density=DPI/g' /system/build.prop      # sed is replacing the DPI with your custom DPI value\nadb reboot\n\nIf none of the solutions work then your only option is to replace build.prop. If you've a clean backup of system partition or build.prop then use it to replace original file, else flash the ROM as OP did.\n\n\n\nNote: I personally did not test, but it has come to my notice to not edit any file of Android using any native text editor of Microsoft Windows OS. Instead, use Notepad++ or altogether do all the editing using command line in recovery.\n"

It's probably sensible to have antivirus software installed, especially since they are so effective, according to the AV-Test Android results here, where some programs get close to 100% detection rates. This website also includes 'Usability', which includes whether the antivirus slows down the device during normal usage.\n",

This backs up everything on the phone's memory as an image and can be restored at any point to fully replace anything on the phone with what it was, even if you installed another version of android.\n\nOtherwise... HTC PC Sync? By that is kinda crappy compared to the other tools.\n", 
            "The requirement being that you must be ROOTED, you could get Titanium Backup and back up your phone using that.\n\nThe reason for using Titanium Backup is so that you can selectively restore parts of your data if you were to install a different version and/or build of Android. NANDROID backup is good for having a safe image to fall back on but it isn't good for restoring data on top of a new OS installation (there are side effects sometimes).\n",

            "If you want to do what is essentially a 1-to-1 backup of your device, you can use a custom recovery to create a \"nandroid\" backup. Doing so effectively creates disk images of your NAND partitions (hence \"nandroid\") that you can restore from at a later point. This is going to vary a bit by device and recovery system, but in general if you want to perform a full backup of your phone's internal memory you would need to:\n\n\nRoot your device and install a custom recovery. The most popular recovery is probably ClockworkMod. How you install it will vary widely by device, but ROM Manager can do it for you on most popular devices. You simply launch ROM Manager and select \"Flash ClockworkMod Recovery\" from the main menu.\nIf using ClockworkMod, open ROM Manager and select \"Backup current ROM\". This should do all of the work for you.\nIf not using ROM Manager or if you use a recovery other than ClockworkMod:\n\n\nReboot your device into recovery mode. This again varies by device, but ROM Manager has a \"Reboot into recovery\" option that works regardless of what recovery you have installed. Another option is to issue adb reboot recovery from a connected PC with ADB configured and set up. There may be other requirements for getting into recovery depending on your device (e.g. the Kindle Fire is very different from others).\nNavigate to the \"Backup/Restore\" or \"Nandroid\" menu (or similar).\nSelect \"Backup\" and (if needed) select which partitions you would like to back up. Some recoveries will also give you the option to compress the backup.\nSelect \"Perform backup\" (or similar) and wait for the process to finish. \n\n\n\nOnce the backup has been performed you should be able to use it to recover from many \"soft\" bricks. However, the two situations you would not be able to recover from with a backup alone would be:\n\n\nYour bootloader is invalid/corrupted/etc\nYour recovery partition is invalid/corrupted/etc\n\n\nIn both of thse scenarios, you would first need to fix the offending partition (bootloader or recovery) before being able to restore the backup. Basically, anything that prevents you from accessing your recovery partition will also prevent you from using your recovery to restore your backup. Such situations are, I would say, fairly rare. You can use a backup to recover a bad /boot or /system partition, so flashing a kernel or ROM should have an extremely small likelihood of permanently bricking your device (unless it modifies your recovery or bootloader, as noted above).\n\nYou may be able to flash an uncompressed backup from fastboot but this would depend on what recovery you are using and how it performs its backups. As I recall, ClockworkMod simply uses dd to create the image and they actually will flash correctly on some devices. However, I would strongly advise researching this before trying as a bad fastboot write could soft brick you as well. Of course, as long as you don't try to overwite your bootloader you won't lose access to fastboot, so in some ways this could be a \"nothing ventured, nothing gained\" situation.\n\nTo actually restore a backup you can:\n\n\nIn ROM Manager select \"Manage and Restore Backups\", then select the backup you wish to restore from.\nIf not using ROM Manager or not using ClockworkMod:\n\n\nReboot into recovery\nSelect \"Backup/Restore\" or \"Nandroid\" (or similar)\nSelect \"Restore\"\nPick the backup you would like to restore from (if more than one)\nSelect the partitions you would like to restore (if givent the option)\nSelect \"Restore\" and wait for the process to finish\n\n\n\nNandroid backups are, by default, stored on your external storage device in pretty much every situation. Some exceptions may be devices with no separate external storage (e.g. devices like the Galaxy Nexus) where the /sdcard directory is actually on the physical internal storage. In any case, though, it will save to your /sdcard directory, which is readable from a PC as USB mass storage or adb. You can copy a nandroid backup off of your phone and onto a computer for safe-keeping, then copy it back over later if you need to restore. \n\nTo do this you can simply plug in your device and look for a path like /sdcard/nandroid (or /sdcard/TWRP for TeamWin recovery, possibly elsewhere for others). Then you can copy the contents of the folder over to your computer. Alternatively, you can pull it with adb by plugging in the device and issuing something akin to:\n\nadb pull /path/to/backups\n\n\n...from a PC shell.\n", 
            "If you don't have root, you can use MyBackup. It can save applications &amp; media (photos, music, videos), and it can save data (contacts, SMS, MMS, alarms, ...). \n\nUnfortunately it requires internet connection (for MyBackup / Rerware account) even for local save and restore (e.g. on SD card), and free version is single phone only (you cannot copy backup to other phone).\n\nNote that non-root version is less powerful than e.g. Titanium Backup or MyBackup Root.\n\n\n\nThere is also Helium (formerly Carbon), which also doesn't require root.\n"

Smart emojis would highlight text like \"dog\" and see if I wanted to replace it with a dog emoji. I have smart emojis turned off. These smileys are totally different.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

I was using Navigation for directions to the airport and also had Listen running to play a podcast over the device speaker.  As I neared the airport, the phone rebooted a few times and then remained off.  I took the phone out of the dock and noticed it was very hot to the touch.  At the airport, the phone had cooled and I plugged it into a wall charger.  The battery was completely drained!  \n\nMy brother had the same experience with his Moto DROID (v2).  He was on a 4 hour road trip and was using the navigation app and participating in a conference call (hands-free).  The phone was connected to the car dock and charging the entire time, but after a couple of hours the phone rebooted and then shut-off with a dead battery.  We left the phone off and plugged into the charger for a while and it was able to boot again, and like with mine showed a dead battery!\n\nIs the phone really able to drain the battery faster than it can be charged via the car dock?  If so, are there known combinations of apps or uses that will cause this behavior?\n", 
        "answer": [
            "I think you answered your own question ;)\n\nNavigation uses a lot of power: it needs constant use of GPS along with reading the map and processing text to speech.  Throw in another power-intensive activity like bluetooth or the phone's speaker (or calling, or data, etc), and it's very conceivable that it would drain power faster than it can pull it from a charger, especially a car charger, though the exact specifics would vary from phone to phone.\n\nHere is a great list of the things that use the most power on a phone.\n", 
            "You can always underclock the phone, I notice a SIGNIFICANT decrease in heat generated which means less energy used. Yes it affects performance, but may give you what you need. Running the EVO 4G (so I can underclock to 50% and still get same mhz as the droid).\n",

There is a difference there.\n",

After this execute a factory data reset (from settings or boot menu) and check you phone if its really clean.\n", 
            "Perform a factory reset then write to the memory and reset again.  This is the best way I have found to prevent data remnance.\n\nI was aware that with a magnetic based drive there is almost always data remnanace.  I believe the standard to effectively erase info on a magnetic drive is erasing and re-writing over the drive 7-20 times (don't quote me on those number).  I was under the impression that once you erased data from flash storage it was gone for good but recalled the story of a woman finding porn on her refurbished Evo. So, I asked about data remnance at Superuser on flash memory and found that data sometimes can remain after it is deleted.  The recommendation there was: formatting, writing to the memory and formatting again.\n\nTo format, as the answers above suggested, I performed a factory reset.  This can be done one of two ways on the Droid:\n\n\nGo to the \"Settings\" menu, choose \"Privacy\" then choose \"Factory Data Reset\"\nDo a hard reset\n\n\nUltimately I just did the Factory Reset because I was too lazy to load the system memory up and I suspect that 99.99% the Factory Reset is sufficient, but it's good to know what the risks are.\n", 
            "As I understand it, factory reset only \"deletes\" user specific files and databases. They still could be recovered if not overwritten at least once. \n\nAlso internal android flash memory is partitioned into several areas with independent file system. Some of these partitions are not directly writable.\n\nI would do the following:\n1. Make a factory reset.\n2. Install as many apps as possible to overwrite almost all of the data blocks in the \"data\" partition.\n3. Make another factory reset.\n\nIf there were a stock ROM to overwrite the currently installed ROM, I would reinstall that ROM, too.\n"
