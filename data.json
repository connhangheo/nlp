It is also easy to install via the <a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.koushikdutta.rommanager\">ROM Manager</a> app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  <strong>Then run a backup before you flash any roms.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also check out <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17152/where-can-i-find-stock-or-custom-roms-for-my-android-device\">\"Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my device\"</a> or <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/\">the XDA forums</a> for other custom roms.  Most devices have a specific \"Android Development\" sub-forum where ROMs are posted.</p>\n\n<p><em>Always do a nandroid backup before installing any rom or mod!</em>  You may also need to wipe all data and cache from your phone before installing or upgrading a ROM.</p>\n\n<strong>Custom Kernels</strong><br><br>\n\n<p>One popular set of kernels is those provided by <a href=\"http://chevyno1.richstevenson.com/froyo/kernels/\">ChevyNo1</a>. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>\n\n<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2ghz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2ghz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>\n\n<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>\n",

                "content": "<p>In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is <strong>freedom</strong>. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.</p>\n\n<p>The main reason people root phones is to install a <strong>custom ROM</strong>. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/9289/why-does-taking-a-screen-shot-require-root-access\">screenshots</a>. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, <a href=\"http://www.androidcentral.com/reviews/rom-review\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rooting Android also allows you to <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6851/how-can-i-uninstall-applications-that-are-locked-by-phone-vendor\">uninstall stock apps</a> that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CarrierIQ#Rootkit_discovery_and_media_attention\">CarrierIQ</a></em>). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage.</p>\n\n<p>A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege. A lot of useful apps were shown on the previous answer, but you may find a lot more available on Google Play. You can find a list of good apps <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1633386\">here</a>.</p>\n",

I am using an external SD card which I use to store data (music/pictures/docs/pdf). For cutting/pasting files I use the ES File Explorer app that was supplied with the tablet. I periodically connect it to my laptop via the USB lead to back up the data. After over a years' use I noticed it becoming sluggish and more unstable, so I performed a factory reset and reinstalled/updated the apps I use most. There was a marked improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I connect to my laptop, and view the external SD card with Windows Explorer prior to backing up, I see that all the folders are shown multiple times (around a dozen or so copies). Looking in these folders, the files icons primarily show as blank - as if the file type is not recognised. It is almost as if these are archived backup versions. Consequently, it takes some time to locate the genuine folder for backup purposes. These duplicate folders do not show up when viewed within Android using ES File Explorer. However, most of the images shown in the Gallery are blank - presumably picking up the file copies. The same occurs when viewing the music files within ES File Explorer - but they cannot be deleted within that app.</p>\n\n<p>As all the files were backed up, I decided to try deleting the \"archive\" folders within Windows Explorer. Not a success, as only a handful of blank images/videos at all are visible within Gallery, and none at all within ES File Explorer on Android. I note the latter now has a Recycle bin, but I have been emptying this, and I have since tried disabling this option.</p>\n\n<p>So - my question is, can anybody suggest what is causing these duplicates, and how can I stop it recurring? Hopefully before I start accumulating more data. </p>\n",

Well, that is to say, Android reads the <code>build.prop</code> as it's normal boot process. Once the Connectivity Service runs, it checks to see if net.hostname is set in the Settings, then if empty, then it uses the \"android_\" + (permanent) android ID. So that's all you need to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Add <code>net.hostname=HOSTNAMEHERE</code> to <code>/system/build.prop</code> (Root may be needed). Leave a blank line at the end of the file.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.git/+/kitkat-release/services/java/com/android/server/ConnectivityService.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitkat's ConnectivityService.java, notice the IF isEmpty statement</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    // setup our unique device name\n    if (TextUtils.isEmpty(SystemProperties.get(\"net.hostname\"))) {\n        String id = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(),\n                Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n        if (id != null &amp;&amp; id.length() &gt; 0) {\n            String name = new String(\"android-\").concat(id);\n            SystemProperties.set(\"net.hostname\", name);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Android 2.3 and Below</h3>\n\n<p>Older versions, Gingerbread, Froyo, etc, just clobber it. It doesn't bother to check. It will set net.hostname to android_24412414... no matter what. So you will need to change it after that Connectivity Service has finished loading. Luckily, it only runs the startup once, not on every new connection. So we just need to run <code>setprop net.hostname HOSTNAMEHERE</code> after that for it to stick. Unfortunately, it runs fairly late in the boot process, so you need something that will make the changes on boot_complete. Most likely an App that runs by itself. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.git/+/froyo-release/services/java/com/android/server/ConnectivityService.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Froyo's ConnectivityService.java</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    // setup our unique device name\n    String id = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(),\n            Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n    if (id != null &amp;&amp; id.length() &gt; 0) {\n        String name = new String(\"android_\").concat(id);\n        SystemProperties.set(\"net.hostname\", name);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>But then there is another issue.</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The net.hostname setting, is not copied to the entire system!</strong> If you use a console/terminal application, you might not get the same hostname. My phone, a Samsung Sidekick 4G (semi-Galaxy S based) has an init.rc which runs <code>hostname localhost</code>, so all underneath commands will not see either your build.prop hostname or the android_id hostname! So you need to set that too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>hostname HOSTNAMEHERE</code> or <code>echo HOSTNAMEHERE &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hostname</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Note: Depending on how you are doing it, you'll need to run the above command as root in order for it to work. Init.rc is typically on the read only system partition, so root access is needed to edit it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The dhcpcd command, which is run to get a dhcp address, will not update to a hostname provided by the server (That can be fixed by adding the right dhcpcd-run-hooks and dhcpcd.conf), and it will not provide a hostname to the dhcp server if <code>$(hostname)</code> (The hostname command) is blank or localhost, and it does not internally use net.hostname. <strong>libnetutils is used for calling dhcpcd with -h \"net.hostname\", but if for some reason it decides not to call with -h, DHCPCD WILL STILL SEND THE SYSTEM HOSTNAME via gethostname(), as long as it's not \"(none)\", \"localhost\", or empty.</strong> On Stock Froyo anyway. Samsung screwed the pooch on some devices like mine. No hostname pass through, forced network time, etc.</p>\n\n<h3>My Solution for Gingerbread and below Samsung, Edit the DHCP Client Daemon config:</h3>\n\n<p>The last thing you can do is edit /etc/dhcpcd/dhcpcd.conf. If you add <code>hostname YOURHOSTNAME</code> to the file, it will use that, unless a hostname is given on the commandline. This won't fix the android_234etc issue, but will if the hostname is localhost (My problem, since Samsung screwed libnetutils and localhost in init.rc). You will need Root, but this works across reboots. This won't work if dhcpcd is called with -h Hostname option.</p>\n",

No special command or script is needed other than <code>cat</code> or <code>dd</code>, the binaries thankfully Android comes with.</p>\n\n<p>Often, the auto mount point of a flash drive is <code>/mnt/usbotg</code> (may differ for your device), so the command would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>dd if=/dev/block/BLOCK_DEVICE of=/mnt/usbotg/FILENAME.img\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Replace <code>BLOCK_DEVICE</code> with the block file's name (the partition you want to copy).

For example: Once i insert the flash drive into Android Smartphone, the dd command run automatically and the acquired image stored to flash drive. (<em>sic</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless you're planning to inject a <a href=\"https://srlabs.de/badusb/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BadUSB</a> into the Android device, you would need an <a href=\"/questions/tagged/automation\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;automation&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">automation</a> app. I found <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tasker</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.gridvision.ppam.androidautomagic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Automagic</a> suitable for the job. Both are paid apps with free trial version available on their site.</p>\n\n<h1>Tasker</h1>\n\n<p>Here is a simple complete profile:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Profile: State &rarr; Hardware USB Connected &rarr;  Mass Storage</li>\n<li><p>Task: (Actions): </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Code &rarr; Run Shell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Command: <code>dd if=/dev/block/BLOCK_DEVICE of=/mnt/usbotg/FILENAME.img</code></li>\n<li>check Use Root</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br/>This should be enough but I prefer to add some glitters here and there. I would wait for 10 seconds after flash drive is mounted before executing the command. I would also give visual indication to myself that Tasker is running the countdown.</p>\n\n<p>All of this can be done by following this simple procedure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set a variable to maximum length of countdown (Variables &rarr; Variable Set)</li>\n<li>Wait for 1 second (Task &rarr; Wait)</li>\n<li>Subtract 1 from the remaining of variable (Variables &rarr; Variable Subtract)</li>\n<li>Cancel any Tasker notification (Alert &rarr; Notify Cancel)</li>\n<li>Give visual indication of countdown (Alert &rarr; Notify &rarr; include variable in Title or Text)</li>\n<li>Repeat the said steps (exclude variable set) for countdown (Task &rarr; Goto &rarr; Action Number: 2)</li>\n<li>Run the command (Code &rarr; Run Shell)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This would work. However, the moment you plug your flash drive into your device, Tasker would seek confirmation whether to continue with this flash drive or not. It can remember the device for future correspondence.</p>\n\n<h1>Automagic</h1>\n\n<p>Automagic would introduce you with a mandatory <em>know-how</em>, so details are not  important here. The basic flow would need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trigger: Storage Media Event; Event: Mounted</li>\n<li>Action: Execute Root Command &rarr; fill the details</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Activate the flow and Automagic's service, and test the flow.</p>\n\n<p>There is one major caveat here. There is no differentiation between the type of storage connected, hence, your flow may trigger if you inject SD card too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Rather than keeping the command inside the apps, you can keep it under a script and place it in your flash drive. Configure your automation app to confirm whether the script exists in the mounted flash drive and if yes, execute it. For confirmation, Tasker already has Read File action. Else, <code>ls \"YOUR_SCRIPT\"</code> should help. </p>\n",

However, for the purpose of fail-safe requirement, change the value to <code>0</code> or empty the file (NULL), should you ever get stuck. </p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the property that you set is stored in a file, hence it remains persistent when you shutdown the device. You can see your value inside the file from recovery mode, provided that you've not booted into Android again after editing the property. Now, once you begin to boot into Android OS, Android <em>et al</em> reads the file, and based on the content, prepares the safe/ordinary mode for you. After reading the file, it resets the content of the file, so the next time you reboot, it would always be in ordinary mode. </p>\n\n<p>I, in my experiments, noticed that Android would boot into safe mode even if the value is any positive or negative integer or even a decimal value. </p>\n\n<p>I got a good hint from source code of <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/lollipop-release/services/core/java/com/android/server/power/ShutdownThread.java#198\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShutdownThread.java</a> that safe mode <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/lollipop-release/services/core/java/com/android/server/power/ShutdownThread.java#295\" rel=\"nofollow\">requires a system property</a> to be set.

We were just\n  discussing that we should have an easier way to generate these as\n  well, I am going to look at adding something to the settings app.</p>\n  \n  <p>I also have started introducing the concept of a <strong>\"development\"\n  permission, which read logs</strong> is classified as.

USB cables of standard make are marked showing the thickness, for example,</p>\n\n<p><code>28AWG/2C and 24AWG/2C</code> or <code>28AWG/1P + 24AWG/2C</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://voyager8.blogspot.in/2013/04/how-to-choose-good-usb-data-and.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">This means</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first code is normally the specification of the data signal pair, which is normally 28AWG. \"2C\" means 2 conductors, and \"1P\" or \"1Pr\" means 1 pair. \"2C\" and \"1P\" are basically the same.</p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>important part is the second code,</strong> which is the specification of the <strong>power distribution pair</strong> (<em>relevant to the solution here</em>) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before we get into details of how to select based on these factors, a quick recap of  basic electrify would help:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ohm's Law  Current = Voltage divided by Resistance\n\nResistance = Length  of cable divided by Area of cable (ignoring resistivity)\n\nPower = Voltage multiplied by Current\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>What do those equations mean?</h1>\n\n<p>Current carrying capacity depends on resistance, for the same Voltage.</p>\n\n<p>Resistance is inversely proportional to the area of the wire ( Less area = Thinner Wire = More Resistance = Less Current )</p>\n\n<p>Resistance is directly proportional to length (Longer cable = More resistance and vice versa )</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power in turn is therefore dependent on length and thickness of cable (affecting resistance) and Voltage</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a nut shell, quoting from <a href=\"http://goughlui.com/2014/10/01/usb-cable-resistance-why-your-phonetablet-might-be-charging-slow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">USB Cable Resistance: Why your phone/tablet might be charging slow</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if you are going to replace your cable with an aftermarket cable, it would be best to see if you can find a cable with the thickest possible conductors for the <strong>power</strong>. If that isn\u2019t possible,\u00a0stick with short (to very short) lengths, as that always works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Power (Voltage times Current), thickness, short lengths are qualitative and need to be in numbers to choose the right cable. For this you need to know, firstly, <strong>Power-</strong>  Refers to the charger rating of your device .  Your device as mentioned is \"incredible\" and <a href=\"http://www.shopandroid.com/samsung-micro-usb-1a-travel-charger/5A17A11813.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Charger for HTC Droid Incredible</a> shows it to be rated for <strong>1A</strong></p>\n\n<p>Next, is <strong>Voltage-</strong> For a\u00a0<strong>5V output</strong>, the USB specification demands that the voltage remains within 5% (i.e. an acceptable voltage drop of 0.25V). Some vendors provide a slightly higher Voltage rating</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.... some vendors have realized the issue (<em>of Voltage drop</em> ) and decided to push the output voltage up to 5.1v or 5.2v, which is still within USB specification but allows for an extra 0.1-0.2v voltage drop. This is a potentially nice feature as it means the requirements on the cables are slightly relaxed (i.e. maybe even 0.7v voltage drop is tolerable).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Choosing the right cable</h1>\n\n<p>You know the Power and Voltage , only thing left is to know the <strong>thickness and length of USB cable</strong>. For that refer to the <a href=\"http://goughlui.com/2014/10/01/usb-cable-resistance-why-your-phonetablet-might-be-charging-slow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tables</a> (choose under the current rating of table <em>With Contact Resistance</em>, which is real life, <em>without contact resistance</em> is to give the effect of cable alone) and look for maximum cable length / thickness combinations by choosing \"non red\" color (green or yellow) which tell you that you can safely choose, as indicated by arrows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>24 AWG cable upto 2 metres in length</li>\n<li>26 AWG cable upto 1 metres in length</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fJIiq.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fJIiq.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Google for this cable specs (normally cables are commonly sold as 24/28 AWG ,in  which case select maximum 1 meter length ) and buy from a reputed vendor. Done!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can calculate the voltage drop using Ohm's law yourself. Tables are for convenience. Helpful pointers on using the tables :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the exact rating of your charger is  not available, say 1.35 A, select the next higher rating or work it out issuing Ohm's law</li>\n<li><em>Green</em> color in table indicates, that the values are compliant to USB standard.</li>\n<li><em>Yellow</em> While yellow-zone figures are not going to be strictly compliant with the USB -0.25V maximum drop, it may still be sufficient for a full charge as many devices can accept somewhat more loss of voltage without detriment to charging</li>\n<li><em>Red</em> Non compliant to standards. Don't use</li>\n<li>For lower current rating upto 1.5 A, selection of yellow zone lengths may still be sufficient for a full charge as many devices can accept somewhat more loss of voltage without detriment to charging. For higher currents (more than 1.5V), you need to be more conservative, so you should choose towards the green.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>For Tablet users: you need to choose what falls in \"green\" zone only, since Voltage drop sensitivity is higher.

If you are, I would recommend getting rid of them -- they are generally cause more problems in the long-run than they solve. If not, then I'm not sure what to tell you other than file a bug report or call Verizon and complain, but neither of these options will fix your problem. </p>\n\n<p>If the problem was at root a signal issue, there is a way to update cell tower information, which Verizon can help you with.

Though it offers only about 1.200 apps<sup>1</sup> in its main repository, they are mostly high quality. In comparision, these are some advantages it has over the Playstore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apps are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\">OpenSource</a>, which means they are all free (to support the devs, there are donation buttons on each apps page)</li>\n<li>F-Droid compiles the packages from the sources. This adds a level of security, as it makes sure nothing was \"sneaked into\". The draw-back is, you cannot simply cross-update apps between the F-Droid main repo and other sources.</li>\n<li>Compiling the sources themselves, they also often throw out \"binary blobs\" and other unfree material (i.e. included modules from proprietary sources). In many cases, this means the advertisement stuff being removed. This again increases security (and privacy). But in some cases it has the draw-back of some functionality being broken, if the removed part was e.g. stuff enabling specific Google services, such as maps.</li>\n<li>Next to its main repository, <a href=\"http://f-droid.org/\">F-Droid</a> offers several others<sup>2</sup>. Developers can provide their own \"channel\", e.g. for Beta versions. A nice way also for companies or organizations to keep together groups of apps their members are supposed to use.</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://f-droid.org/\">F-Droid</a> is very clear when it comes to \"anti-features\" such as ads. If an app in any way deviates from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\">OpenSource</a> idea, that's pointed out straight in colored boxes you can't miss when browsing the apps pages. Quoting bgvaughan from the comments:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>f-droid's Preferences allow you to screen apps by various traits: whether they contain advertising, track your activity, or promote non-free add-ons, among others. While I miss the lack of user ratings on f-droid, and f-droid app versions sometimes trail behind those on Google Play, the fact that I can be sure that anything on f-droid is free, open-source, and not a freaking PITA, is more than enough to recommend its use.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can also only approve what Nicolas says about <a href=\"http://f-droid.org/\">F-Droid</a> in his comment:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>F-Droid apps are guaranteed open source, ad-free, tracking-free. That means smaller apps that don't waste your bandwidth for anti-features.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>F-Droid</em> also offers its own Android client, the <em>F-Droid</em> Application Manager:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fz242.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fz242m.jpg\" alt=\"F-Droid App\"></a><br>\n<sup><em>F-Droid App</em> (source: <a href=\"http://www.androidnext.de/apps/f-droid-repository-fuer-open-source-apps/\">AndroidNext</a>; click for larger variant)</sup></p>\n\n<p>More details on <em>F-Droid</em> can also be found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid\">at Wikipedia</a>.

Paulo Trezentos, co-founder of Aptoide, kindly pointed out several details behind Aptoide in <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/a/74813/16575\">his answer</a> on <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/74618/16575\">How safe is it to use Aptoide?</a> And even more in a mail he sent to me. Some core-points:</p>\n\n<p><ul>\n<li>Like <em>Google Play</em>, <a href=\"http://www.aptoide.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aptoide</a> actively scans its repositories for malware. They're using 3 different malware scanners, doing signature checks, and having implemented a chain-of-trust based in the signature of the developers.</li>\n<li>They work with several universities and research centers to make and keep the environment as safe as possible.</li>\n<li>They use a \"trust stamp\" to mark apps they've thoroughly checked (see <a href=\"http://m.aptoide.com/1000contest\" rel=\"nofollow\">1000contest</a>). If you see that on the page for an app, you can consider it 99.9% safe (according to Paulo).<sup>1</sup><br>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6JCXp.png\" alt=\"Trusted\"></li>\n<li>Privacy is considered a high value. <em>Aptoide</em> is very cautious about the way they internally handle the user\u2019s private information.</li>\n<li>Their \u201cApps\u201d store is manually curated. So when looking for a way to stay as safe as possible with all those hundred-thousands of repositories, this would be the place (all the app links in this post point there). But even towards all the other repos, Paulo states:<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>we have a responsibility to assure that the apps in those stores do not harm the end user.</li>\n  </ul>\n  In his mail to me, Paulo concluded: <em>Believe we still can do better.</em> Which to me indicates they don't settle on what they have achieved, but try to continually improve. If you additionally consider there's a company behind the \"stores\" which recently even <a href=\"http://www.electronista.com/articles/14/06/18/claims.google.abusing.position.over.third.party.app.store.measures/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide files European antitrust complaint over Google Play dominance\">filed an antitrust complaint against Google</a>, that should be sufficient to deviate from associating <em>Aptoide</em> with \"black markets\" and \"piracy\" any more than <em>Youtube</em> \u2013 but rather consider it a good alternative (or supplement) to other Android app markets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are some more advantages worth mentioning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you can have your own repository there \u2013 whether private or public.

Logical conclusion is that identifier being the GSF<sup>1</sup> <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1860405\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"XDA: Android Device-ID\"><code>android_id</code></a>. When you register your \"replacement\", a new <code>android_id</code> will be created for your specific installation<sup>2</sup>, and stored with the device's configuration. This serves as device identifier for all related operations/interactions between your device and Google services, e.g. for GCM<sup>3</sup> and Google Play (apps).</p>\n\n<p>Hence I'd say it's safe to assume the same is used by ADM<sup>4</sup>, as it's part of Google Services as well. So as long as you don't restore a full backup of your old device, but register e.g. via the setup assistant, your replacement will get a new <code>android_id</code> and thus not receive the \"wipe request\" addressed at a different <code>android_id</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another proof to that I've just <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/2eox2b/multiple_devices_with_the_same_android_id/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Reddit: Multiple devices with the same android ID\">found on Reddit</a>: Someone had setup multiple devices using the same Nandroid backup taken from a fully configured device, and hence with the same <code>android_id</code>.

The latter is not really part of a relevant answer, and indeed there is already a question here: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1/ive-rooted-my-phone-now-what-what-do-i-gain-from-rooting\">what can a rooted phone do?</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sure rooting equals getting admin rights, but let's add some more details: how admin rights are <em>implemented</em> in Android. Whats happens, on a technical level, when you root a phone? A new program/applet becomes available: <strong>su</strong>. It sits in the /system/xbin/ folder and allows users to switch to a different user ID --including root (aka admin).</p>\n\n<p>Remember that in android applications normally run under their own user ID. So if 1) su exists and 2) an app uses it to change to root, then the app can do anything the root user could do! </p>\n\n<p>Not all rooting methods produce the same change. For example many methods rely on an additional app called superuser.apk that has a custom version of the su binary. This lets the app act as a permission control manager whenever su is invoked by an app. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to su and superuser (or SuperSu), often busybox gets installed as part of the rooting script. These three files (technically busybox is a set of files) are the most common additions when we talk about rooting a phone.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is not trivial to just copy a <code>su</code> to the folder yourself, as the /system partition is mounted read only and you need root rights to (re)mount it as writable (and you'd need write permissions if it was). </p>\n\n<p>One 'indirect' way of doing this is using a recovery with extended functionality, it can mount /system as writable and copy files to it. In most cases this means flashing a custom recovery, as many stock recoveries are limited to patching only specific (OEM) files.</p>\n\n<p>A more 'direct' way would be to directly flash a new /system partition (with root files) using some flashing tool. Such tools include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>odin(PC--Samsung only)</li>\n<li>fastboot(PC--Generic Android)</li>\n<li>flashify(app--Generic Android)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is relatively easy to copy the /system partition from your phone--or an image file from the web, and flash the root-modified partition back. Lastly you may be able to get a root shell using ADB, if the ROM was compiled to allow it (not common in stock ROMs). Using the root shell it is trivial to remount partitions and copy files anywhere you want--if you know linux commands.</p>\n\n<p>These simple methods work for phones that are unlocked/easy to unlock. When a bootloader is locked the process of rooting can become a convoluted process that may differ between devices, see more specific rooting info <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-android-device\">here</a>.\nThis is because any custom modifications to important partitions will break the OEM 'signature' and cause the bootloader to refuse loading (bootloop). Or, in some cases the bootloader will just undo any changes.</p>\n",

At 1C, a battery rated 1,000mAh charges at a current of 1,000mAh. In an ideal world the battery would be fully charged in 60 minutes. At 1C, the same battery discharges at 1,000mA. Ideal charging rate is accepted to be around 0.5 to ,0.8 C for maximum battery life (battery life is measured in discharge cycles). This rate is decided by the OEM and coded in the charging algorithm implanted on ROM and varies</p>\n\n<p>b)  <strong>Battery Capacity (mAh)</strong> or size as commonly referred. Charging rate is varied dependent on this by OEM. Battery capacity of your Asus device is 3950 mAh, Nobis is 2500 mAh, Droid Mini 2130 mAh </p>\n\n<p>c) <strong>Battery Type</strong>  Not really relevant since most mobile devices and tablets use Li-Ion or Li-Po batteries</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p><strong>Li-Ion or Li-Po charging</strong> When you charge a battery at charging rate decided by OEM, it goes through four stages of charging (Constant Current Charge,Saturation Charge and Ready No Current and Ready), see Figure 1 of <a href=\"http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries\" rel=\"nofollow\">BU-409 Charging Li-Ion</a>. As you can see from graph voltage and current vary so if you are measuring current using an app like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ampere</a> and derive wattage from current reading, <strong><em>you could end up in wrong comparison</em></strong> if you are not measuring in the same stage of charging</p></li>\n<li><p>OEM proprietary charging methodology can also significantly vary current.

Doing so will result in poor battery performance. Simply put, <strong>forcing the battery to charge faster by increasing the current will result in a battery that discharges faster</strong>.

                "content": "<p>If you want to do what is essentially a 1-to-1 backup of your device, you can use a custom recovery to create a \"nandroid\" backup. Doing so effectively creates disk images of your NAND partitions (hence \"nandroid\") that you can restore from at a later point. This is going to vary a bit by device and recovery system, but in general if you want to perform a full backup of your phone's internal memory you would need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Root your device and install a custom recovery. The most popular recovery is probably <a href=\"http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager\">ClockworkMod</a>. How you install it will vary widely by device, but <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&amp;hl=en\">ROM Manager</a> can do it for you on most popular devices. You simply launch ROM Manager and select \"Flash ClockworkMod Recovery\" from the main menu.</p></li>\n<li><p>If using ClockworkMod, open ROM Manager and select \"Backup current ROM\". This should do all of the work for you.</p></li>\n<li><p>If not using ROM Manager <strong>or</strong> if you use a recovery other than ClockworkMod:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reboot your device into recovery mode. This again varies by device, but ROM Manager has a \"Reboot into recovery\" option that works <em>regardless</em> of what recovery you have installed. Another option is to issue <code>adb reboot recovery</code> from a connected PC with ADB configured and set up. There may be other requirements for getting into recovery depending on your device (e.g. the Kindle Fire is very different from others).</li>\n<li>Navigate to the \"Backup/Restore\" or \"Nandroid\" menu (or similar).</li>\n<li>Select \"Backup\" and (if needed) select which partitions you would like to back up. Some recoveries will also give you the option to compress the backup.</li>\n<li>Select \"Perform backup\" (or similar) and wait for the process to finish. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once the backup has been performed you should be able to use it to recover from many \"soft\" bricks. However, the two situations you would not be able to recover from with a backup alone would be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your bootloader is invalid/corrupted/etc</li>\n<li>Your recovery partition is invalid/corrupted/etc</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In both of thse scenarios, you would first need to fix the offending partition (bootloader or recovery) before being able to restore the backup. Basically, anything that prevents you from accessing your recovery partition will also prevent you from using your recovery to restore your backup. Such situations are, I would say, fairly rare. You <strong>can</strong> use a backup to recover a bad <code>/boot</code> or <code>/system</code> partition, so flashing a kernel or ROM should have an extremely small likelihood of permanently bricking your device (unless it modifies your recovery or bootloader, as noted above).</p>\n\n<p>You <em>may</em> be able to flash an uncompressed backup from <code>fastboot</code> but this would depend on what recovery you are using and how it performs its backups. As I recall, ClockworkMod simply uses <code>dd</code> to create the image and they actually will flash correctly on some devices. However, I would <strong>strongly advise researching this before trying</strong> as a bad fastboot write could soft brick you as well. Of course, as long as you don't try to overwite your bootloader you won't lose access to <code>fastboot</code>, so in some ways this could be a \"nothing ventured, nothing gained\" situation.</p>\n\n<p>To actually restore a backup you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In ROM Manager select \"Manage and Restore Backups\", then select the backup you wish to restore from.</li>\n<li><p>If not using ROM Manager <strong>or</strong> not using ClockworkMod:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reboot into recovery</li>\n<li>Select \"Backup/Restore\" or \"Nandroid\" (or similar)</li>\n<li>Select \"Restore\"</li>\n<li>Pick the backup you would like to restore from (if more than one)</li>\n<li>Select the partitions you would like to restore (if givent the option)</li>\n<li>Select \"Restore\" and wait for the process to finish</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nandroid backups are, by default, stored on your external storage device in pretty much every situation. Some exceptions may be devices with no separate external storage (e.g. devices like the Galaxy Nexus) where the <code>/sdcard</code> directory is actually on the physical internal storage. In any case, though, it will save to your <code>/sdcard</code> directory, which is readable from a PC as USB mass storage or <code>adb</code>. You can copy a nandroid backup off of your phone and onto a computer for safe-keeping, then copy it back over later if you need to restore. </p>\n\n<p>To do this you can simply plug in your device and look for a path like <code>/sdcard/nandroid</code> (or <code>/sdcard/TWRP</code> for TeamWin recovery, possibly elsewhere for others). Then you can copy the contents of the folder over to your computer. Alternatively, you can pull it with <code>adb</code> by plugging in the device and issuing something akin to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>adb pull /path/to/backups\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...from a PC shell.</p>\n",
